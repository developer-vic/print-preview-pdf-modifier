# Print Preview PDF Modifier v3.0

A full-stack PDF modification tool that intercepts PDF files online and automatically modifies text portions based on configuration settings. The tool consists of a backend API for PDF processing and a frontend automation system that monitors web traffic and intercepts PDF downloads. Version 3.0 includes advanced shipment automation features for integrating Shopify and Packlink systems.

## üìã Overview

This tool automatically intercepts PDF files when they are accessed online, extracts text content, identifies target text portions based on your configuration, and replaces them with your specified text. The modified PDF is then automatically printed or displayed. Additionally, version 3.0 includes a shipment automation system that synchronizes order information between Shopify and Packlink platforms. This is particularly useful for automating PDF modifications and order processing without manual intervention.

## üéØ How It Works

### PDF Interception Flow
1. **PDF Interception**: The frontend automation monitors browser network traffic and intercepts PDF file requests
2. **Text Extraction**: When a PDF is detected, it's downloaded and sent to the backend API for text extraction
3. **Text Matching**: The backend searches for configured text patterns within the PDF
4. **PDF Modification**: If matches are found, the PDF is modified with the replacement text
5. **Auto-Print**: The modified PDF is automatically displayed and triggers the print dialog

### Shipment Automation Flow
1. **Initialization**: After Packlink login, system checks for shipment IDs in `shipments.txt`
2. **Shopify Login**: Automatically logs into Shopify with cookie persistence
3. **Batch Processing**: For each shipment ID:
   - Opens Shopify tab and searches for the order in the table
   - Clicks on the order to view details
   - Opens Packlink tab and filters by shipment ID
   - Extracts tracking number from carrier section
   - Triggers print of shipping label
   - Returns to Shopify and fills tracking number + sets carrier to LaPoste
4. **Completion**: All tabs remain open for verification

## üîß Configuration

### Main Configuration File

All configuration is stored in `frontend/config.js`. This file contains:

```javascript
{
  // Browser settings
  browser: {
    headless: false,
    args: ['--disable-web-security', '--disable-features=VizDisplayCompositor']
  },
  
  // Packlink credentials
  credentials: {
    email: 'your-packlink-email@example.com',
    password: 'your-packlink-password'
  },
  
  // URLs
  urls: {
    login: 'https://auth.packlink.com/fr-FR/pro/login?tenant_id=PACKLINKPROFR',
    main: 'https://pro.packlink.fr/private/shipments/ready-for-shipping'
  },
  
  // Text replacement settings
  textReplacement: {
    find: 'text-to-find',
    replace: 'text-to-replace'
  },
  
  // Backend service
  backendUrl: 'http://localhost:3000',
  
  // Shipment automation
  shipmentPath: 'shipments.txt',
  
  // Shopify integration
  shopify: {
    email: 'your-shopify-email@example.com',
    password: 'your-shopify-password',
    loginUrl: 'https://accounts.shopify.com/lookup',
    loginUrl2: 'https://accounts.shopify.com/login',
    homeUrl: 'https://admin.shopify.com/store/YOUR-STORE/apps/scaniziorders',
    cookiePath: 'shopify-cookies.json'
  }
}
```

### Shipment Automation Setup

1. **Create config file**: Copy the example config and edit with your credentials:
   ```bash
   cp frontend/config.js.example frontend/config.js
   # Edit frontend/config.js with your credentials
   ```

2. **Create shipment file**: Create `frontend/shipments.txt` with one shipment ID per line:
   ```
   168344
   168345
   168346
   ```

3. **Configure Shopify store URL**: Update the `shopify.homeUrl` in `config.js` with your actual Shopify store name.

4. **Run automation**: The automation will automatically start after successful Packlink login if shipment IDs are found.


## üìä API Endpoints

### Backend API (`http://localhost:3000`)

- `POST /api/extract-text` - Extract text from uploaded PDF
- `POST /api/extract-text-url` - Extract text from PDF URL
- `POST /api/modify-pdf` - Create modified PDF with text replacements
- `GET /api/health` - Health check endpoint

## Dependencies

This project combines dependencies from both backend and frontend:

### Backend Dependencies
- Express.js for API server
- PDF.js for PDF processing
- PDF-lib for PDF manipulation
- Security and middleware packages

### Frontend Dependencies
- Playwright for browser automation
- Form-data for HTTP requests
- File system utilities

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **PDF Not Loading**: Check console logs for detailed error messages
2. **API Errors**: Verify URL format and network connectivity
3. **Print Dialog Not Appearing**: Check browser permissions and popup blockers
4. **Text Not Found**: Verify text replacement configuration in `frontend/config.js`
5. **Configuration Not Loading**: Ensure `frontend/config.js` is properly formatted

### Debug Mode

Enable detailed logging by checking console output. The system provides comprehensive logging for:
- PDF request interception
- Download progress
- Text extraction results
- PDF modification process
- Print dialog triggering

## Security Notes

- **Never commit credentials**: The `config.js` file contains sensitive credentials and should be added to `.gitignore`
- **Keep credentials secure**: Store your credentials securely and never share them publicly
- **Cookie files**: Cookie files (`cookies.json` and `shopify-cookies.json`) are automatically created and excluded from git
- **Browser data**: The `browser-data/` directory is excluded from version control

## Development

The project uses `concurrently` to run both services simultaneously during development, and a custom launcher script for production deployment.
